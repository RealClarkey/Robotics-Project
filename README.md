# Robotics-Project
5 Tasks from year 2 robotics module. Using python to control robots and learn robotic principles.

# Project 1 - Line Following Robot
This task focuses on object-oriented programming and practical robot control using the CoppeliaSim simulation environment. The primary objective is to develop a wrapper class for a line-tracing robot, allowing Python-based control through the CoppeliaSim API. Students are expected to complete the robot class by defining methods for motor control and sensor reading, then use this structure to design and implement a basic line-following algorithm.

The robot must navigate a predefined track by interpreting data from three vision sensors (left, middle, right). The algorithm should enable the robot to detect and follow a black line by adjusting its movement dynamically based on sensor input. This workshop builds foundational skills in robotics programming, Python OOP, and simulation-based algorithm testing.
